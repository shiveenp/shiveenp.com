# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Shiveen Pandita, currently an engineer at Atlassian. I am passionate about building
tech and leading teams to building software with purpose.

In my free time I like to spend time cooking, exploring new hiking trails and spending time with my family.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiveenp/), [X](https://x.com/shiveen_p), [Github](https://github.com/shiveenp) or [Email](mailto:blog@shiveenp.com).
